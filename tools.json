      "overview": "This tool scans ESRI File Geodatabase (.gdb) directories and identifies layers with zero features. It provides both a graphical interface (Tkinter) and command-line operation for batch processing. The tool helps maintain clean geodatabase structures by removing unused layers that accumulate during data processing workflows.",
